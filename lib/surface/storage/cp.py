      The following command uploads all text files from the local directory to a
      bucket:

        $ {command} *.txt gs://my-bucket

      The following command downloads all text files from a bucket to your
      current directory:

        $ {command} gs://my-bucket/*.txt .

      The following command transfers all text files from a bucket to a
      different cloud storage provider:

        $ {command} gs://my-bucket/*.txt s3://my-bucket

      Use the `--recursive` option to copy an entire directory tree. The
      following command uploads the directory tree ``dir'':

        $ {command} --recursive dir gs://my-bucket
